For vs2017 environment.
1) For every new project, we need include the quantlib and boost directory. We also need to reference their lib directory.
2) You may see errors because of using depreciation function. To solve this problem, we need to set in Project properties->Configuration Properties->C/C++->Preprocessor->Preprocessor Definitions

3)If use VS2017, the boost version should be 1.66. Unless there will be compile error about template.
